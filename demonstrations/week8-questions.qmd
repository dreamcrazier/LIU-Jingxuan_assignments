## 1. AR(2)

Consider the AR(2) equation $$
X_t = \phi_1 X_{t-1} + \phi_2 X_{t-2} + W_t.
$$

a.  Under what conditions on $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ is the model causal?
b.  Under what conditions on $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ does the ACF have periodic behavior?
c.  The conditions on a) are equivalent to $$
    \phi_1 + \phi_2 < 1, \quad \phi_2 - \phi_1 < 1, \quad |\phi_2| < 1.
    $$ What region in 2D does this correspond to?
d.  Use the function `ARMAacf()` to compute ACF plots for a few different choices of parameters.

## 2. Linear process coefficients.

Given an AR(p) model
$$
X_t = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \psi_j W_{t-j},
$$
write the coefficients in terms of the parameters $\phi_1,\phi_2,\ldots,\phi_p$.

## 3. AR(p) theorems

Understand the proofs of the theorems.
